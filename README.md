# Terraform workshop

This project was created for the Infrastructure as Code Course WS2023 at the FH Technikum Wien.

**Why do we need Terraform Cloud (or another backend) when we use CI/CD?**

Because we need a centralized and secure location to store and manage Terraform state files. This is crucial for team collaboration and maintaining the state consistency required in CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, it offers access controls, secret management, and a history of state changes.
